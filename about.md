My name is Maciek. I do iOS since 2010 and mobile since 2005 (Symbian S60).

Currently I focus on continuously delivering **decoupled UI layers** for iOS apps. It's a pretty innovative approach to software development that relies on creating strict border between UI layer and underlying business logic and developing them independently.

I firmly believe that such modularisation is a good way to seize a complexity of software projects, scale teams, fill the personnel gaps and it allows teams to build extendable and changeable apps with lots of benefits arising from the specialisation.

If that sounds like something that can be helpful to your team or you as a freelancer feel free to get in touch via [email](mailto:hello@mczarnik.com).
