My name is Maciek. I do iOS since 2010 and mobile since 2005 (Symbian S60).

Currently I focus on continuously delivering **decoupled UI layers** for iOS apps. It's a pretty innovative approach to software development that creates strict border between UI and underlying business logic so both parts can be developed independently.

I firmly believe that such modularisation is a good way to scale teams, fill the personel gaps and it allows teams to build extendable and changeable apps with lots of benefits arising from the specialisation.

If that sounds like something you're looking for in your team or need more info please get in touch via [email](mailto:hello@mczarnik.com).
